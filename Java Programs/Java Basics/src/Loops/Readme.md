## 📖 Overview
This folder contains my structured practice for mastering loop constructs in Java.  
It focuses on building strong fundamentals in **iteration, control flow, and common loop-based problem patterns** used in coding interviews and real-world programming.

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered
| Loop Type | Description |
|----------|------------|
| 🔹 **For Loop** | Counter-controlled loops, nested loops, and pattern-based iteration |
| 🔹 **While Loop** | Condition-based loops, sentinel values, and input-driven logic |
| 🔹 **Do-While Loop** | Guaranteed single execution, menu-driven programs, and validation |

## 📂 Folder Structure
```text
loops/
│
├── ForLoop.java       # Basic and nested for loop examples
├── WhileLoop.java   # Condition-based loop logic
└── DoWhileLoop.java # Menu-driven and validation loops



🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand when and why to use each type of loop

Write clean, readable, and efficient iteration logic

Handle edge cases like zero iterations and off-by-one errors

Build confidence in solving loop-based interview problems

🚀 How to Run

Compile:

javac ForLoop.java


Run:

java ForLoop


(And You Can Repeat the same steps for WhileLoop.java and DoWhileLoop.java)

🧠 Notes

Each file includes comments explaining the logic step-by-step

Common mistakes and edge cases are handled where applicable

This folder is part of my larger Java + DSA Practice Repository

🧩 Next Steps

Add pattern printing problems (stars, numbers, pyramids)

Add loop-based array traversal problems

Combine loops with conditionals for mini-projects
